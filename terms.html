            informal means, the arbitration of Disputes will be administered by
            a third-party arbitrator not affiliated with CLOSER, in accordance
            with commercial arbitration rules, and if deemed appropriate by the
            arbitrator, any supplementary procedures for consumer disputes.

            including any proceeding to confirm, modify, or vacate an
            arbitration award, may be brought in any court of competent
            jurisdiction. In the event that this arbitration agreement is for
            any reason held to be unenforceable, any litigation against CLOSER
            (except for small-claims court actions) must be commenced only in
            China. You hereby irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction of and

            g.&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, and

            be filed within six months after the date in which the incident
            giving rise to the Dispute occurred. Failure to file an arbitration
            claim as described above within the applicable limitation period
            constitutes a waiver of such claim and serves as a complete bar to
            any claim based on any Dispute.

          <p>
            h.&nbsp;&nbsp;This Terms, and any Dispute between you and our users
            or CLOSER, shall be governed by the laws of China without regard to
            principles of conflicts of law, provided that this arbitration
            agreement shall be governed by China.
